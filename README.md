# sequence-labeling
CRFsuite model 
The goal of this assignment is to get some experience with sequence labeling. Specifically, you will be assigning dialogue acts to sequences of utterances in conversations from a corpus. In sequence labeling it is often beneficial to optimize the tags assigned to the sequence as a whole rather than treating each tag decision separately. With this in mind, you will be using a machine learning technique, conditional random fields, which is designed for sequence labeling. You will be using the toolkit, CRFsuite.
